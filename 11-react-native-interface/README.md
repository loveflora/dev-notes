# Responsive User Interface for Cross-Platform Compatibilitye

I implemented a user interface that is compatible across different platforms and device sizes, using the Number Guessing Game as a foundation. The design ensures seamless adaptation to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop. By considering platform-specific characteristics and responsiveness, the interface adjusts efficiently to fit any device or screen resolution.
