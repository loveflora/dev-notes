# üîê Authentication & üîî Notifications in React Native

This section covers the implementation of authentication in React Native,<br/> including user login, signup processes, and managing user sessions securely. <br/><br/>
It involves utilizing libraries like Firebase or custom backend APIs to handle user authentication and maintaining state across app sessions.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, this section includes **local notifications** and **push notifications**:

- **Local Notifications**: Users can receive alerts and reminders within the app, even without an internet connection.
  <br/>
- **Push Notifications**: These enable real-time updates and messages sent from a server to users' devices, enhancing engagement.
