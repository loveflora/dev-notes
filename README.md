## 9. Authentication & Notifications in React Native

This section covers the implementation of authentication in React Native, including user login, signup processes, and managing user sessions securely. <br/>
It involves utilizing libraries like Firebase or custom backend APIs to handle user authentication and maintaining state across app sessions.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, it includes implementing both local notifications and push notifications.<br/>
• Local notifications allow users to receive reminders and alerts within the app, even without an internet connection.<br/>
• Push notifications enable real-time updates and messages sent from a server to users’ devices, enhancing user engagement.

## 11. Responsive User Interface for Cross-Platform Compatibility

I implemented a user interface that is compatible across different platforms and device sizes, using the Number Guessing Game as a foundation. The design ensures seamless adaptation to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop. By considering platform-specific characteristics and responsiveness, the interface adjusts efficiently to fit any device or screen resolution.
